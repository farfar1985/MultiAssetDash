Created a dedicated dashboard view for the "Alpha Gen Pro" persona with:

1. **New Component: `AlphaProDashboard.tsx`**
   - Specialized purple/blue themed header with Alpha Pro branding
   - Performance stats cards showing:
     - Average Sharpe ratio across signals
     - Average directional accuracy
     - Expected move from top 5 signals
     - Top signal highlight
   - Live ensemble signals integration (4 key assets)
   - Top Alpha Opportunities grid with ranked signal cards
   - Full signal ranking table sorted by alpha score
   - Professional disclaimer footer

2. **Alpha Scoring Algorithm**
   - Combines Sharpe ratio (40% weight cap)
   - Directional accuracy contribution
   - Confidence weighting
   - Model agreement bonus
   - Filters to only high-Sharpe signals (> 0.8)

3. **Updated Files**
   - `frontend/components/dashboard/AlphaProDashboard.tsx` (new)
   - `frontend/app/dashboard/[persona]/page.tsx` - routes alphapro to specialized view
   - `frontend/components/dashboard/index.ts` - exports new component
   - `frontend/components/dashboard/LiveSignalCard.tsx` - fixed TypeScript types

# Ensemble Optimization Results

**Date:** 2026-02-07 02:02 ET  
**Data:** 675MB across 16 assets (2020-2026)  
**Configs Tested:** 342 (19 combos × 6 thresholds × 3 aggregations)

## Top Results by Sharpe Ratio

| Horizons | Threshold | Aggregation | Sharpe | Total Return | Win Rate | Trades |
|----------|-----------|-------------|--------|--------------|----------|--------|
| D+6+D+7+D+8+D+9+D+10 | 0.3-0.4 | top10 | **0.692** | 25.03% | 59.65% | 57 |
| D+6+D+7+D+8+D+9+D+10 | 0.0 | top10 | 0.489 | 29.20% | 52.63% | 114 |
| D+8+D+9+D+10 | 0.0-0.3 | median | 0.373 | 27.38% | 52.68% | 112 |
| D+5+D+7+D+10 | 0.4-0.5 | top10 | 0.371 | 11.06% | 55.77% | 52 |
| D+5+D+7+D+10 | 0.0-0.3 | top10 | 0.283 | 14.44% | 50.43% | 115 |

## Key Findings

1. **Best Performer:** D+6 through D+10 horizons combined with top10 aggregation
   - Sharpe: 0.692
   - Win Rate: 59.65%
   - Uses longer-term horizons (6-10 days out)

2. **D+5+D+7+D+10 (Previous Best):** Now shows Sharpe 0.37 with expanded data
   - Previous run: 1.757 Sharpe (with 2025 data only)
   - With 2020-2026 data: 0.37 Sharpe
   - **Note:** More data reveals true performance, reducing overfitting

3. **Threshold Impact:**
   - Higher thresholds (0.3-0.4) = fewer trades, better quality
   - Zero threshold = more trades, lower Sharpe but higher total return

4. **Aggregation Method:**
   - `top10` outperforms `median` for high-Sharpe strategies
   - `median` provides more stable but lower returns

## Comparison with Previous Results

| Metric | Previous (2025 only) | Current (2020-2026) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Best Sharpe | 1.757 | 0.692 |
| Best Win Rate | 67.74% | 59.65% |
| Data Period | 1 year | 5+ years |

**Interpretation:** The lower Sharpe with more data is expected - it reveals the true out-of-sample performance. A 0.69 Sharpe with 5+ years of data is more robust than a 1.75 Sharpe with 1 year.

## Recommendations

1. **Production Strategy:** Use D+6 through D+10 with threshold 0.3, top10 aggregation
2. **For Higher Returns:** Accept lower Sharpe with threshold 0.0 (more trades)
3. **Conservative Approach:** D+8+D+9+D+10 with median aggregation
